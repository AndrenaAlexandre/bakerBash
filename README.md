# Baker Bash 

Welcome one and all the most addictively delicious game you will see today! 

### Objective

The objective of this game is to get as many brownie points as possible by helping Betty Baker package matches of 3 and 4 similar baked goodies.
Whoever gets the most brownie points wins!!

# Development

Baker Bash was my individual part of a group project called Smack Board!
Smack Board was created as an online arcade to play different solo player and even multiplayer games. 
The multi player game has the feature of video chat and messaging to allow you to "Talk Smack!" as you play.

## Humble Beginnings

As you can see this started off with a completely different name and appearance, but the objective of making matches remained!

## Languages
This game was written in Javascript and HTML. I used Photoshop to create my own baked goodies and some CSS styling to make it all come together.
